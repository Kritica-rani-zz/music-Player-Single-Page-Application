Hi!
All files are arranged beforehand.

#extract the zip file.
#there are two files for two of the screen.
#there is resources folder in each of the file which contains images,icons,vectors,etc.
#although some images and icons are embedded from other sites which needs to be loaded.
#index.html is the html file in both folders with their respective style.css files.

Thanks!
